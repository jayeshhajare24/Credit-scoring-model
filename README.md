# Credit-scoring-model
This project builds a Credit Scoring Model to predict whether a customer will default on credit card payment in the next month.

The model is trained using the UCI Credit Card Default Dataset containing 30,000 customer records with financial and demographic features.

The objective is to help financial institutions identify high-risk customers and reduce potential financial losses.
